**Project description:** A simple car rental application, When the application first opens, the rental customer will be presented with a login screen. The rental customer will provide his/her Oracle login information. The application will authenticate the credentials by logging into Oracle. After logging in, the application user is presented with a screen containing a list of all existing reservations. Use a GridView for the list of reservations. If there are no reservations, the page should display a message stating that. The GridView should show the vehicleâ€™s licence plate, the model and the type, as well as the name of the customer who made a reservation.
The user will be allowed to either cancel existing reservation or to make a new reservation. If any change is made, the GridView will be repopulated from the database to show the records currently stored in the database.
Logout button must be provided to allow the user to log out when done.
